## Hello!

I am a Software Engineering student at The University of WaterlooðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I am looking for summer 2021 internships and you can find my resume [here](https://github.com/vikramsubramanian/resume/blob/master/Resume.pdf)! 


I am currently an intern at [Wind River](https://github.com/Wind-River). I have previously interned at [Thomson Reuters](https://innovation.thomsonreuters.com/en/labs.html) and [Sandvine](https://www.sandvine.com/)


I am also interested in Software Engineering Research and am working at SWAG Lab, University of Waterloo with [Prof. Mei Nagappan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~m2nagapp/). You can find some of my research publications [here](https://github.com/vikramsubramanian/what_should_my_first_open_source_contribution_be/blob/master/what_should_my_first_open_source_contribution_be.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/vikramsubramanian/first_time_OSS_contributors/blob/master/first_time_OSS_contributions.pdf). 


A little article about my research work- [here](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/news/cheriton-faculty-members-graduate-undergraduate-students-win-four-awards-at-icse-2020).


A project I've been working on that archives research tools- [segarage.org](https://segarage.org/)
